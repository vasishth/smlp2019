### Additional short course on Friday (two 90 minute lectures) by [Ralf Engbert](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/expbiopsy/staff/ralf-engbert.html)

 An introduction to stochastic-dynamical models and to determinstic dynamical models. In the stochastic model lecture, the drift-diffusion model is presented and its link to Bayesian modeling made clear [see](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00102/full). In the second lecture, continuous-time discrete-state Markov processes will be covered, and an application area will be presented: eye-movement control in reading, focusing on two prominent models, E-Z Reader and SWIFT.
