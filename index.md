## Welcome to The Third Summer School on Statistical Methods for Linguistics and Psychology, 2019, 9-13 September

## Schedule

You can download the floor plan of the Griebnitzsee campus building (Haus 6) and the schedule for the summer school from [here](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/sfb1287/index.html).

## Summer School Location

[Griebnitzsee Campus, University of Potsdam, Germany](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/db/zeik-portal/gm/lageplan-up.php?komplex=3)

The summer school will be held at the Griebnitzsee campus of the University of Potsdam; this is about 15-20 minutes away from Berlin zoo station by train. Lectures will be held in Haus 6. The introductory session on Monday morning and invited lectures will be held in Hoersaal H02. Campus map: [download from here](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/db/zeik-portal/gm/griebnitzsee.pdf).

### Advanced Bayesian methods (maximum 30 participants)

Instructors: [Bruno Nicenboim](http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~nicenboim/) and [Shravan Vasishth](http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/)

Topics will be some selection of the following topics:

    - Review of basic theory

    - Measurement error models
    - Modeling censored data 
    - Meta-analysis 
    - Finite mixture models
    - Model selection and hypothesis testing 
      (Bayes factor and k-fold cross-validation)
 
### Additional short course on Friday (two 90 minute lectures) by [Ralf Engbert](to-do)

 An introduction to stochastic-dynamical models and to determinstic dynamical models. In the stochastic model lecture, the drift-diffusion model is presented and its link to Bayesian modeling made clear [see](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00102/full). In the second lecture, continuous-time discrete-state Markov processes will be covered, and an application area will be presented: eye-movement control in reading, focusing on two prominent models, E-Z Reader and SWIFT.

## Funding

This summer school is funded by the [DFG](dfg.de) and is part of the [SFB "Limits of Variability in Language"](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/sfb1287/index.html).
