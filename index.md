Title: *Does Everyone? Modeling Individual Differences in Cognitive Tasks*

Abstract: 
In psychological science, the main target of interest usually is an empirical effect. For example, we may be interested in human perception and ask participants to react to light spots flashing up on a screen as fast as they can. Psychologists typically ask whether, on average, participants respond faster to bright lights than to dim ones. We may extend this question to the individual participant level: Does everyone react to bright lights faster than to dim ones? In case of perception, this seems reasonable: After accounting for sample noise, we probably would expect that indeed everyone is better at perceiving higher-signal visual stimuli. Yet, we may not expect that everyone throws a ball further with their right hand than their left hand. Clearly, left-handed people may not. I propose a modeling approach to the “Does Everyone” question using Bayes factor model comparison with hierarchical models. This modeling approach allows researchers to distinguish between quantitative and qualitative individual differences, and the lack thereof. I apply the approach to data from the Stroop interference task, and discuss the implications of “Everyone Does” to large-scale correlational studies of individual differences.

Title: *Bayesflow: Tools for data analysis following a principled Bayesian workflow*

Abstract: Probabilistic programming languages such as Stan, which can be used to specify and fit Bayesian models, have revolutionized the practical application of Bayesian statistics. They are an integral part of Bayesian data analysis and as such, a necessity to obtain reliable and valid inference. However, they are not sufficient by themselves. Instead, they have to be combined with substantive statistical and subject matter knowledge, expertise in programming and data analysis, as well as critical thinking about the decisions made in the process. A principled Bayesian workflow consists of several steps from the design of the study, gathering of the data, model building, estimation, and validation, to the final conclusions about the effects under study. I want to present a concept for a software package that assists users in following a principled Bayesian workflow for their data analysis by diagnosing problems and giving recommendations for sensible next steps. This concept gives rise to a lot of interesting research questions we want to investigate in the upcoming years.

Title: *An introduction to stochastic-dynamical models and to determinstic dynamical models*

Abstract: 
In the stochastic model lecture, the drift-diffusion model is presented and its link to Bayesian modeling made clear [see](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00102/full). In the second lecture, continuous-time discrete-state Markov processes will be covered, and an application area will be presented: eye-movement control in reading, focusing on two prominent models, E-Z Reader and SWIFT.

Title: *The great parade of statistical errors in NHST – A large-scale simulation study*

Abstract: It is well known that conducting multiple tests of the same hypothesis inflates false positive effects (Type 1 error).  We also know that low statistical power inflates false negative effects (Type 2 errors) and increases the size of Type M and the rate of Type S errors.  But how bad are these problems really?  And how can they be addressed?  I will present a large-scale simulation investigating these questions in great detail using eye-tracking research of reading behavior as an example. (No prior knowledge of eye-tracking is needed to follow the talk.)  The results suggest these problems are quite real and they show that the interpretation of results from NHST procedures is considerably more difficult than is commonly appreciated.  Regarding remedies, we will look at the Bonferroni correction, ways to increase statistical power, the role of computational models in formulating precise testable hypotheses, and pre-registration.
